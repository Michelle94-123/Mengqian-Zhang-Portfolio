# Grid of Line Chart: OECD General Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio, 1995-2019
The grid of line chart shows general governemnt debt-to-GDP ratio changes of OECD countries from 1995 to 2019. You can easily see the trend of ratio changes, increase, decrease or steady. Please note that we don't have data for all years for countries, so the line chart of a specific country may not cover all years from 1995 to 2019.

# Scatter Chart: OECD General Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio, 1995-2019
I created a scatter chart to show the distribution of General Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio of OECD countries from 1995 to 2019. I also used multiple colors to represent different levels of Debt-to-GDP Ratio. But to aviod the rainbow effect, I selected colors that belongs to blue and green categories. You can easily see the distribution changes from 1995 to 2019, and can easily identify the outlier countries in the scatter chart.

# Summary and Comparison
The three types of charts have merits and drawbacks. The bart chart can show the debt-to-GDP ratio of multiple countries in a specifi year, just like we selected data in 2019 for the first chart. But it is not able to show the ratio in all years, and is not able to show the ratio changes of different countries from 1995 to 2019. Generally speaking, the bart chart is a easy tool to visulize. The second chart, grid of line chart, is able to clearly show the ratio changes of different countries from 1995 to 2019, but falis to show the ratio gap between those countries. I selected the scatter chart because it is able to show the distribution of General Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio of OECD countries from 1995 to 2019, and to show the ratio gap between those countries in all years. Additionally, audience can easily catch the outlier countries from the chart, which is also facilitated by the use of multiple colors for scattered dots.
