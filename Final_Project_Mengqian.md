# An Outline
This final project aims to show the electricity production and consumption situations of OECD member countries in year 2019 and 2020.

The major elements of my story are: (1) Electricity production by different fuels in 2019 and 2020; (2) The electricity production by different fuels across OECD member countries in different continents in year 2019; (3) The electricity dependence rate (the fraction of imported electricity in electricity supplied) comparison across all OECD member countries; (4) To achieve sustainable economic growth, I care about the fraction of electricity produced by renewable fuels in total net electricity production for all OECD member countries. (5) To test my assumption whether the more total net electricity production, the more electricity exports, I want to show the correlation between electricity exports and total net electricity production with data of all OECD member countries; (6) To improve the utility ratio of electricity (the fraction of electricity consumed in electricity supplied), I want to see the distribution of utility ratio of electricity across all OECD member countries.

At the end of the project, I will also try to provide suggestions for electricity production and consumption from the perspective of regional cooperation based on my investigations.

# Initial Sketches
Although I have not started my investigation with detailed information and data, I still want to show the major elements of my story with a few sketches here.

# The Data
My primary data sources is from the office website of International Energy Aency (IEA). IEA provides monthly electricity production and trade statistics up to 2020. If you download the Excel file, you can see the data of electricity production, trade and consumption of all OECD member countries in November 2020, Year-to-Date data in 2019 and 2020 and all-year data in 2019. A point we should pay attention to is that we don't have data in December 2020. So, for comparison between 2019 and 2020, we had better use the Year-to-Date data. 

And then, to facilitate my analysis, I need to compile the statistics for each country into one dataset in which each row represents a country and each colum represents what I want to show, such as electricity supplied, electricity production by specific fuel or electricity consumption. In addition, I need to add a few colums for items not appearing in original data and need to be calculated, such as electricity utility rate and the fraction of electricity produced by renewable fuels.

The link to the publicly-accessible datasets is here. You can access the data by clicking the "Download" button on the left side of the page and selecting "Latest Data".

# Method and Medium
To complete my final project, firstly, I'm going to finish a few key data visualizations on Flourish, and then finish the interactive section using Shorthand.

To organize my final presentation, I probably use a few PowerPoint slides to frame the context of my project, but my major work will be shown throgh Shorhand.
