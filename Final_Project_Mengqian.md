# An Outline
This final project aims to show the electricity production and consumption situations of OECD member countries in year 2019 and 2020.

The major elements of my story are: (1) Electricity production by different fuels in 2019 and 2020; (2) The electricity production by different fuels across OECD member countries in different continents in year 2019; (3) The electricity dependence rate (the fraction of imported electricity in electricity supplied) comparison across all OECD member countries; (4) To achieve sustainable economic growth, I care about the fraction of electricity produced by renewable fuels in total net electricity production for all OECD member countries. (5) To test my assumption whether the more total net electricity production, the more electricity exports, I want to show the correlation between electricity exports and total net electricity production with data of all OECD member countries; (6) To improve the utility ratio of electricity (the fraction of electricity consumed in electricity supplied), I want to see the distribution of utility ratio of electricity across all OECD member countries.

At the end of the project, I will also try to provide suggestions for electricity production and consumption from the perspective of regional cooperation based on my investigations.

# Initial Sketches
Although I have not started my investigation with detailed information and data, I still want to show the major elements of my story with a few sketches here.
