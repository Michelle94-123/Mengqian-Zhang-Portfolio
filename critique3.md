# Original Data Visualization
This visualization I selected shows under-5 and neonatal mortality rate across the world from 2000 to 2017. I selected this topic because I’m quite interested in sustainable development across the world. And I selected this visualization to critique because it’s different traditional grid of line chart, so there is more space for me to redesign it.

The original chart is shown below.

# Data Visualization Redesign Process
The critique method provides some insights of critique for me. I used the seven criteria that Stephen Few mentioned in Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile to start my data redesign. For aspects working well, the chart is professional and follows Minor Colors Principle because it only used green that is also the theme color of the chapter it’s included. In addition, the chart placed the regions from left to right with the ranking of mortality rate roughly from high to low numbers, so that audience can easily know which regions have higher or lower mortality rate. But, there are some aspects that don’t work well. 

(1) The placement of regions on x-axis did not strictly follow the descending order of mortality rate. 

(2) “2000” and “2017” were vertically placed and repeated 9 times, which seems redundant. 

(3) Names of those regions were sideling, and the whole chart was not wide enough to create breathing room. 

(4) The two lines representing world average mortality rate were on the rightmost position, which makes it somewhat difficult for audience to identify which regions have higher or lower mortality rate than world average level. 

(5) The color for lines of world average level was also green, the same color as that for specific regions.

And then, I moved to wireframes according to the 5 concerns I mentioned above. Here follows my solutions to solve the 5 problems.

(1) Rearrange the regions strictly following the descending order of mortality rate;

(2) Put “2000” and “2017” horizontally on x-axis and simplify the wording;

(3) Place names of those regions horizontally and create more breathing room for the whole chart;

(4) Place the two lines of world average mortality rate among lines of specific regions following the descending order;

(5) Use gray color for two lines representing world average mortality rate.

My redesigned visualization is shown below


# Improvement from User Feedback
To improve my redesigned chart, I gave it to several friends and asked for their comments and feedbacks. A problem stand out to them is the color I used for the chart. In my sketching, I used blue to represent regions with higher mortality rate than world average level, and green for those with lower mortality rate than world average level. But my friends thought that blue should not be used here because the theme color of the chapter that this chart belongs to is green, as a result green and gray are enough for this chart. And then, to differentiate under-5 and Neonatal mortality rate, dashed line is a good choice.

# Final Redesigned Visualization
My final redesigned visualization after improvement from user feedback is shown below.

We can learn from the chart that under-5 and neonatal mortality declined in all regions, with the fastest progress in regions where levels were highest, yet stark disparities persist across regions and countries.
