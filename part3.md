# How I Created My Project in Part One and Part Two
I firstly determined that the theme of my final project is about electricity production and consumption across OECD countries.

In Part One, I introduced an outline of the project which includes six elements about fuel usage, electricity imports and exports, renewable fuels and electricity utility rate. And then I created visualization sketches of the six elements to serve as the main body of the project. I also included the introduction of data sources and how I want to use the data for further analysis. At the end of Part one, I decided to use Shorthand for my final data story presentation.
