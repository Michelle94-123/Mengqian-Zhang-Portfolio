# How I Created My Project in Part One and Part Two
I firstly determined that the theme of my final project is about electricity production and consumption across OECD countries.

In Part One, I introduced an outline of the project which includes six elements about fuel usage, electricity imports and exports, renewable fuels and electricity utility rate. And then I created visualization sketches of the six elements to serve as the main body of the project. I also included the introduction of data sources and how I want to use the data for further analysis. At the end of Part one, I decided to use Shorthand for my final data story presentation.

And then, in Part Two, I firstly created wireframes of my project including the visualizations of my six elements with Flourish. And then I used sketches to design the presentation storyboard that shows how audience will go through my presentation. After that, I implemented user research and interviews aiming to get some feedback of my project from targeted audience. Finally, I claimed some user research findings and some changes of the story telling. You can click the link here to see more details of Part Two. [Link to Final Project Part Two](/part2.md)
