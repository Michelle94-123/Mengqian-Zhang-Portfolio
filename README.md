This is my public portfolio for the course named Telling Stories with Data at CMU.

# About me
Hi, I'm a student in the Telling Stories with Data course. My name is Mengqian Zhang, my instructors and friends always call me Michelle at CMU. I'm a second-year Public Policy and Management student. I take this course because I'm quite interested in data visulization techniques especially in the real business environment. I'm planning to dive into the private equity investment industry and be an investment analyst after graduation because I'm crazy about the new trend of science and technology industry and want to make many innovative ideas be used into practice with the help of capital.

# What I hope to learn
From this course, I hope to learn controlling color theories, chart selection principles, the layout arrangement skills for business presentation documents and how to make simple data visulization videos.

# Portfolio
Here's where all my cool data visulization will go!
